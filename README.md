### Background
------
BulleTrades is a full stack web application inspired by Robinhood. BulleTrades allows 
users to personalize their account by having them create an account and protect them with
a session token and password that is never saved or displayed to other users. As a customer,
you have the ability to search for any ticker and make real time buy and sell orders
that will impact your overall buying power. Users also have the ability to view real-time information 
about a ticker before placing a trade giving them the power to analyze a stocks worth. 
Visually, the site incorporates a live chart that users can hover over and check their progress 
for each stock and their respective portfolio.
